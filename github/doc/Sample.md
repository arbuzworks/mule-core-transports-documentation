*    Find and drag **GitHub** Cloud Connector to the flow. Double click it to show its properties. Set **Display name** as **GitHub. Create repository**. Adjust rest of the fields as it shown on the following image. 

![Create createRepository flow](images/step4-3.png) 

*    Save the flow. 

### Step 5: Run project

*    Right Click **src/main/app/demo.xml \> Run As/Mule Application**.

![Run Project](images/step5-1.png) 

*    Check the console to see when the application starts.  

You should see a log message on the console:  
 
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    
    + Started app 'demo'                                       +    
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   

### Step 6: Test createRepository flow

*    Once the application is started, open your browser and point it to [http://localhost:8081/createrepo](http://localhost:8081/createrepo).   
*    Then log on GitHub using your credentials. Find **Repositories** tab and click on it, you should see a page showing you newly created repository.

*    Stop Mule server. 

### Step 7: Create createIssue flow

*    Add a new flow by dragging it from the Palette.    
*    Double click the new flow to open its properties and rename it to **createIssue**. Click **OK**.   
*    Then drag **HTTP Endpoint** to the flow. Double click it to show its properties and adjust them as it displayed on the following image.

### Step 8: Test createIssue flow

*    Run mule application.  
*    Once the application is started, open your browser and point it to [http://localhost:8081/createissue](http://localhost:8081/createissue).   
*    Switch to your previously opened page on **GitHub**. Find **Contributions** tab and click on it, you should see something like that ![new issue](images/new_issue.png) at the bottom of the page. Number standing before the issue title is an issue id.  Then click on the issue title, you should see page with your issue open.

*    Stop Mule server.  

### Step 9: Create createComment flow

*    Add a new flow by dragging it from the Palette.    
*    Double click the new flow to open its properties and rename it to **createComment**. Click **OK**.

### Step 10: Test createComment flow

*    Run mule application.  
*    Once the application is started, open your browser and point it to [http://localhost:8081/createcomment](http://localhost:8081/createcomment).   
*    Switch to your previously opened page on **GitHub** and refresh it. You should see new comment.     

![Test createComment flow](images/step10-1.png) 

*    Stop Mule server.  

### Step 11: Create editComment flow

*    Add a new flow by dragging it from the Palette.    
*    Double click the new flow to open its properties and rename it to **editComment**. Click **OK**.   
*    Then drag **HTTP Endpoint** to the flow. Double click it to show its properties and adjust them as it displayed on the following image.
